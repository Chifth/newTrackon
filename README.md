# newTrackon

[![Requirements Status](https://requires.io/github/CorralPeltzer/newTrackon/requirements.svg?branch=master)](https://requires.io/github/CorralPeltzer/newTrackon/requirements/?branch=master)

newTrackon is a service to monitor the status and health of existing open and public trackers that anyone can use.
It also allows to submit new trackers to add them to the list.

newTrackon is based on the abandoned [Trackon](http://repo.cat-v.org/trackon/) by [Uriel â€ ](https://github.com/uriel).


**By default, newTrackon needs IPv4 and IPv6 internet connectivity, and the application won't start without both.
Run with arguments `--ignore-ipv6` or `--ignore-ipv4` to skip this check.**

## Arguments
run.py [--address ADDRESS] [--port PORT] [--ignore-ipv4]
              [--ignore-ipv6]

optional arguments:
  * `--address ADDRESS`  Address for the flask server
  * `--port PORT`        Port for the flask server
  * `--ignore-ipv4`      Ignore newTrackon server IPv4 detection
  * `--ignore-ipv6`      Ignore newTrackon server IPv6 detection


## Installation

### With Docker
Build the image with
```
docker build -t newtrackon .
```
and run the application
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 newtrackon --address=0.0.0.0
```
You can now access to the main page opening in your browser `http://localhost:8080`.

### With pipenv
Make sure you have `python3.6`, `pip` and `pipenv`.
